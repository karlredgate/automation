## `BOOT-INF`

 * `classpath.idx`
 * `layers.idx`
 * `classes/`
 * `lib/`

## `WEB-INF`

     Now web-inf contains information, and data about the web application. It contains servlet classes, and other library/utility classes; it could also contain properties files. It could contain any other information which you want to keep private.

Each web application should be contained in a war (web archive) file. War files are nothing but a jar file containing atleast one descriptor called web.xml. The file structure of war file is:

```
/--
   |
   | WEB-INF
   |   |
   |   |-- WEB.XML (Deployment descriptor)
   |   |-- classes (Folder containing servlets and JSPs
   |
   | META-INF
   |   |
   |   |-- MANIFEST.MF
   |
   | all utility files and resources like error pages etc.
```


## `META-INF`

You can also place static resources in there.

In example:

META-INF/resources/button.jpg 
and get them in web3.0-container via

http://localhost/myapp/button.jpg

The /META-INF/MANIFEST.MF has a special meaning:

If you run a jar using java -jar myjar.jar org.myserver.MyMainClass you can move the main class definition into the jar so you can shrink the call into java -jar myjar.jar.
You can define Metainformations to packages if you use java.lang.Package.getPackage("org.myserver").getImplementationTitle().
You can reference digital certificates you like to use in Applet/Webstart mode.

### `MANIFEST.MF`

The manifest file that is used to define extension and package related data.

### `INDEX.LIST`

This file is generated by the new "-i" option of the jar tool, which
contains location information for packages defined in an application
or extension. It is part of the JarIndex implementation and used
by class loaders to speed up their class loading process.

### `x.SF`
The signature file for the JAR file. 'x' stands for the base file name.

### `x.DSA`

The signature block file associated with the signature file with
the same base file name. This file stores the digital signature of
the corresponding signature file.

### `services/`

This directory stores all the service provider configuration files.
