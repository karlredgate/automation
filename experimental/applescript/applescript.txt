to Handler in paramName

An AppleScript-defined label.
The available labels are:
about, above, against, apart from, around, aside from, at, below,
beneath, beside, between, by, for, from, instead of, into, on, onto,
out of, over, since, thru (or through), under.
These are the only labels that can be used without the special label given.
Each label must be unique among the labels for the handler (that
is, you cannot use the same label for more than one parameter).
